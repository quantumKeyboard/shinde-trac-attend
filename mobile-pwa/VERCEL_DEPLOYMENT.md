# Vercel Deployment Guide - Shinde Tractors Mobile PWA

This guide will help you deploy the Mobile PWA to Vercel securely, ensuring no sensitive information is exposed.

---

## üîê Security First

**IMPORTANT**: Your `.env` file contains sensitive Supabase credentials. This file is automatically excluded from deployment via `.gitignore` and `.vercelignore`.

**Never commit or upload your `.env` file!**

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ Supabase project set up and running
- ‚úÖ Mobile PWA tested locally (`npm run dev`)
- ‚úÖ Vercel account (free tier is sufficient)
- ‚úÖ Your Supabase URL and anon key ready

---

## üöÄ Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended for First-Time)

This is the easiest method and doesn't require Git.

#### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

1. **Test Build Locally First**:
   ```powershell
   cd "D:\Projects\ShindeTractors Employee Attendance\mobile-pwa"
   npm run build
   ```
   - Should complete without errors
   - Creates a `dist` folder
   - Verify no `.env` file in `dist` folder

2. **Verify Security Files Exist**:
   - ‚úÖ `.gitignore` exists (prevents Git commits)
   - ‚úÖ `.vercelignore` exists (prevents Vercel uploads)
   - ‚úÖ `vercel.json` exists (deployment config)

#### Step 2: Create Vercel Account

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Choose sign-up method:
   - GitHub (recommended if you have GitHub)
   - GitLab
   - Bitbucket
   - Email
4. Complete sign-up process

#### Step 3: Deploy via Dashboard

**Option A: Direct Upload (No Git Required)**

1. Log into Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Add New..." ‚Üí "Project"
3. Scroll down to "Import Third-Party Git Repository" or look for manual upload option
4. **STOP! Don't upload the folder directly**
5. Instead, use Vercel CLI (see Method 2)

**Recommended: Use Vercel CLI for better control**

---

### Method 2: Vercel CLI (Recommended)

The CLI gives you better control over what gets deployed.

#### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

```powershell
npm install -g vercel
```

Wait for installation to complete.

#### Step 2: Login to Vercel

```powershell
vercel login
```

- Choose your preferred login method
- Follow the prompts to authenticate
- You should see "Success! Authentication complete"

#### Step 3: Deploy the App

1. Navigate to the mobile-pwa folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "D:\Projects\ShindeTractors Employee Attendance\mobile-pwa"
   ```

2. **IMPORTANT: Verify .env is NOT committed**:
   ```powershell
   # This should show .env is ignored
   type .gitignore
   type .vercelignore
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```powershell
   vercel
   ```

4. **Answer the Setup Questions**:
   ```
   ? Set up and deploy? [Y/n] ‚Üí Press Y
   ? Which scope? ‚Üí Select your account
   ? Link to existing project? [y/N] ‚Üí Press N (first time)
   ? What's your project's name? ‚Üí shinde-tractors-attendance (or your choice)
   ? In which directory is your code located? ‚Üí Press Enter (current directory)
   ? Want to override the settings? [y/N] ‚Üí Press N
   ```

5. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - Vercel will build your app
   - Upload the build files
   - Deploy to their servers
   - This takes 1-3 minutes

6. **Deployment Complete!**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Production: https://shinde-tractors-attendance-xxx.vercel.app
   ```
   - Copy this URL - this is your production app!

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables on Vercel

**CRITICAL STEP**: Your app needs Supabase credentials to work.

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your project "shinde-tractors-attendance"
3. Click on the project
4. Go to **Settings** tab
5. Click **Environment Variables** in left sidebar
6. Add your environment variables:

   **Variable 1:**
   - **Key**: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Supabase URL (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **Environment**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Key**: `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Supabase anon key (the long string starting with `eyJhbGc...`)
   - **Environment**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

7. **Redeploy with Environment Variables**:
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click the three dots (...) on latest deployment
   - Click **Redeploy**
   - Check "Use existing Build Cache"
   - Click **Redeploy**
   - Wait for redeployment to complete (~1-2 minutes)

#### Step 5: Test Your Deployed App

1. Open the production URL in your browser:
   ```
   https://shinde-tractors-attendance-xxx.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Verify it works**:
   - ‚úÖ Login page loads
   - ‚úÖ Can login with your credentials
   - ‚úÖ Can see attendance page
   - ‚úÖ Data loads from Supabase
   - ‚úÖ Can mark attendance

3. **Test on Mobile**:
   - Open the URL on your phone's browser
   - Should work smoothly
   - Try installing as PWA:
     - Chrome: Menu ‚ãÆ ‚Üí "Install app"
     - Safari: Share ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"

---

### Method 3: Git Integration (Advanced)

If you want automatic deployments on code changes:

#### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```powershell
cd "D:\Projects\ShindeTractors Employee Attendance\mobile-pwa"
git init
```

#### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `shinde-tractors-attendance`
4. **Important**: Choose **Private** repository (not public!)
5. Don't initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

#### Step 3: Push Code to GitHub

```powershell
# Verify .env is in .gitignore BEFORE committing!
type .gitignore | findstr ".env"

# Should see: .env

# Add all files (except those in .gitignore)
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - Mobile PWA"

# Add remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shinde-tractors-attendance.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 4: Connect Vercel to GitHub

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Add New..." ‚Üí "Project"
3. Click "Import Git Repository"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Configure project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
6. Add environment variables (same as Method 2, Step 4)
7. Click "Deploy"

#### Step 5: Automatic Deployments

Now, whenever you push changes to GitHub:
```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push
```
Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy!

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Build Failed" on Vercel

**Solution 1**: Check build locally first
```powershell
npm run build
```
Fix any errors shown.

**Solution 2**: Check Node version
- Vercel uses Node 18+ by default
- Your app requires Node 18+
- Should work fine

### Issue: App Loads but "Connection Error"

**Solution**: Environment variables missing
1. Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Verify both `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
3. Redeploy the app

### Issue: "Invalid credentials" when trying to login

**Solution**: Supabase authentication issue
- Verify user accounts exist in Supabase dashboard
- Check Supabase credentials in Vercel environment variables
- Ensure Supabase project is active and not paused

### Issue: Environment variables not working

**Solution**: Variable names must start with `VITE_`
- ‚úÖ Correct: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `SUPABASE_URL`
- After fixing, redeploy

### Issue: "This site can't be reached"

**Solution**: Check deployment status
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check deployment status (should be "Ready")
3. Wait a few minutes if still deploying
4. Check for any deployment errors in logs

### Issue: Changes not appearing after deployment

**Solution**: Clear cache
- Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache
- For mobile PWA: Uninstall and reinstall the app
