**Solution**: User account issue
- Check email and password are correct
- Verify user was created in Supabase Authentication
- Try "Forgot Password" flow

### Issue: Desktop app won't open

**Solution**: Electron issue
- Delete `node_modules` folder
- Run `npm install` again
- Try `npm run dev` instead of double-clicking

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
